## ðŸ“„ Description

This project aims to sort a stack A using another stack B with the fewest possible moves!

The available operations are as follows:

    (sa): Swap on A
    (sb): Swap on B
    (ss): Swap on A and B
    (pa): Push the first element of B onto A
    (pb): Push the first element of A onto B
    (ra): Rotate A
    (rb): Rotate B
    (rr): Rotate A and B
    (rra): Reverse rotation of A
    (rrb): Reverse rotation of B
    (rrr): Reverse rotation of A and B

Three limits are defined as follows:

    3 numbers: maximum of 5 moves
    100 numbers: maximum of 700 moves
    500 numbers: maximum of 5500 moves

This project does not aim to be the fastest, but out of a sense of perfectionism, I have optimized its performance to the maximum: `0.03s user 0.00s system 98% CPU 0.031s total` for 500 numbers.

Algorithms used:

Two algorithms coexist: the Turkish algorithm and a median value sorting algorithm.

## ðŸ“¥ Installation

Installation and compilation commands :
